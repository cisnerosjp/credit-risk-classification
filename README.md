## The Task
We are tasked to use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. We were provided a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify a borrowers creditworthiness. We were first tasked with importing the data and then splitting the data into training and testing sets. From there we had to create a logistic regression model with the original data. Lastly, we were to write a credit risk analysis report. I have yet to fully complete this challenge but will revisit when time permits.

## Navigating this repository
The code for this repository can be found in the Challenge_Code directory, where you can find the "credit_risk_classification.ipynb", a file "report-template.md" which I will use to write the report when I revisit this challenge, and a subdirectory entitled "Resources" that contains the CSV file that has to be read into this exercise in order to obtain our data, "lending_data.csv".

## Data Provided
For this tasks we were provided several files. They include the credit_risk_classification.ipynb which contained the pseudocode explaining what needed to be done at each step. Our data for the project was present in the lending_data.csv file which was provided as well.

## Code Sources
The code in this repository was sourced from starter code provided by the bootcamp as well as from in-class activities, and documentation libraries for sklearn.metrics to include sklearn.metrics confusion_matrix and classification_report for certain aspects of this challenge. At times I did have to utilize google for simple queries and information.
